# Iris-Flower-Species-Prediction
A Flask-based web application to predict the species of Iris flowers using a machine learning model.
This project provides a simple web interface where users can input flower measurements, and the app returns a prediction of the flower species based on the trained machine learning model.

## Files in This Project
+ **app.py** - The main Flask application script
+ **iris.csv** - The dataset used to train the model.
+ **iris_class.ipynb** - The jupyter notebook file used to train and load the model.
+ **model.pkl** - The pre-trained model file used for predictions.
+ **model.py** - A python file also used to train the model (same as jupyter notebook file).

  ## Technologies used
  + **Flask** - Web framework to handle  HTTP requests.
  + **Pandas** - For data manipulation and preprocessing.
